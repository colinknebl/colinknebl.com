# About

Hi! Thanks for taking the time to check out my site!

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for software development.
My current language of choice is TypeScript, and am starting to
dive more into Rust.

I live and work in West Michigan with my wife and three kids. I enjoy
spending time with my family and friends (but who doesn't), a good
podcast (Syntax.fm and Software Engineering Daily are a couple of my
favorites), and exercising (no seriously).
