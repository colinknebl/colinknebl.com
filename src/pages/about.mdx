# About

Hi! Thanks for taking the time to check out my site!

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for software development.
My current language of choice is TypeScript, and am starting to
dive more into Go.

I live and work in West Michigan with my wife and three kids. I enjoy
spending time with my family and friends, serving the community through 
my church, a good podcast ([Undaunted.life](https://www.undaunted.life/)
and [Shawn Ryan Show](https://shawnryanshow.com/) are a couple of my favorites),
studying my Bible and reading about theology, woodworking, and getting in a good workout.
